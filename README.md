# 6-DOF Robot Control System

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a 6-DOF robot control system. The system is designed to control a robotic arm with six degrees of freedom, providing precise and versatile motion capabilities. This project is aimed at robotics enthusiasts, researchers, and developers interested in building and experimenting with 6-DOF robotic systems.

## Features

- **Six Degrees of Freedom:** The robot arm is equipped with six joints, enabling it to move in a wide range of motions, making it suitable for various applications such as pick-and-place, assembly, and more.

- **Inverse Kinematics:** The repository includes algorithms for solving the inverse kinematics problem, allowing users to easily specify desired end-effector positions and orientations.

- **Motion Planning:** Implementations of motion planning algorithms help optimize the robot's movements, avoiding obstacles and ensuring efficient and smooth trajectories.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 6-DOF robot control system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the arduino Ide.
3. Understand the code structure and functionality.
4. Load the provide code to the board.
